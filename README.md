# vue-dynamics

## Basic synopsis:
*A fluid overview of what this project is as it progresses.*

Currently, this project has little rhyme or reason to its use
and general construction. I have done this intentionally so 
that when the idea for a great example project comes around I
will have plenty of sample material to borrow from.

### Coding Best Practices:
*Not all people are perfect, only their intent.*

This project is and will evolve more into being and amalgamation
of best practices and best typing standards. Typescript has 
been added on a nominal level, with Docker and Lint to be added
soon.

### Advanced practices:
*Not all practices are covered in one place.*

The intent of this project is to bring together multiple ideas
related to how Vue 2 is programmed and distributed, with an
eye toward selecting the best ideas and putting them in front
of those who seek out demonstrations of good and solid 
coding habits and practices. **Meh**
